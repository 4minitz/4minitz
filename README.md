## Quick Start
You have two options to quickly evaluate a local demo 
installation at your site.

1. Use our ready-to-go docker image (recommended!) or
1. Install meteor. Then build and run 4Minitz locally


### Option 1: Use 4Minitz docker image (Linux, Mac & Windows)
**Attention:** Option 1 is only one possibility of running a production
server.
Don't miss the [Admin Guide](doc/admin/adminguide.md)
with a more comprehensive coverage of the real production
building & installation topic!

The 4Minitz docker image includes the compiled 4Minitz app, a fitting 
node.js version and MongoDB and thus has no external dependencies.

See the admin guide for
[how to configure your 4Minitz docker server](doc/admin/adminguide.md#production-running---with-docker).


### Option 2: Clone, build & run your own (Linux, Mac)
**Attention:** Option 2 is for quick testing only.
It is intended for developers and so it has some security drawbacks (No
password protection for MongoDB) and also consumes some amount of extra RAM
(>700 MB)). Don't miss the [Admin Guide](doc/admin/adminguide.md)
with a more comprehensive coverage of the real production installation topic!

#### Prerequisites
4minitz is realized with the [Meteor JS Framework](http://www.meteor.com). So, first install the current version of meteor:

    curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
    meteor --version

To download fresh code form github you will need `git` in your path.

You'll need root rights for that. As a non-root user you may install
meteor by:

    git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/meteor/meteor.git
    cd meteor
    meteor --version
    sudo ln -s ./meteor /usr/local/bin/meteor

On Windows? [Download the meteor installer](https://install.meteor.com/windows). 
As experienced Windows admin you sure can transfer the below steps for Linux and Mac to your OS.

#### Quick Installation of 4Minitz (Linux & Mac)   
OK, here we go! For a quick test installation perform:

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/4minitz/4minitz.git --branch master --single-branch
    cd 4minitz
    cp settings_sample.json settings.json
    ./runapp.sh

Wait some time for meteor to finish downloading and building. 
You can reach 4Minitz via the default port 3100 by opening 
[http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) in your browser

**Hint:** There exists a settings_sample.json file that has quite a few configuration options
(like sending eMails etc.). Don't miss the [Admin Guide](doc/admin/adminguide.md) with more details
 on this topic.
