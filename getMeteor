# This is the Meteor alternative install script!
#
# The official installation is using:
#     npm install -g meteor.
#
# Read more https://www.meteor.com/developers/install
#
# To install using this alternative method run on Mac or Linux:
#     curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
#
#   Meteor currently supports this alternative method on Mac and Linux

# We wrap this whole script in a function, so that we won't execute
# until the entire script is downloaded.
# That's good because it prevents our output overlapping with curl's.
# It also means that we can't run a partially downloaded script.
# We don't indent because it would be really confusing with the heredocs.

# Now, on to the actual installer!

## NOTE sh NOT bash. This script should be POSIX sh only, since we don't
## know what shell the user has. Debian uses 'dash' for 'sh', for
## example.

Couldn't write the launcher script. Please either:

  (1) Run the following as root:
        cp "$LAUNCHER" /usr/bin/meteor
  (2) Add "\$HOME/.meteor" to your path, or
  (3) Rerun this command to try again.

Then to get started, take a look at 'meteor --help' or see the docs at
